# ðŸ›’ SQL E-Commerce Funnel Analysis Project

This project explores how users interact with products in an e-commerce setting by tracking their behavior across four key funnel stages:

1. `product_view`
2. `add_to_cart`
3. `begin_checkout`
4. `purchase`

---

## ðŸ“Š Objectives

- Calculate **conversion rates** at each step of the funnel
- Identify products with the **highest and lowest purchase rates**
- Join events with product metadata (name, category, price)
- Deliver actionable insights for marketing or product strategy

---

## ðŸ§  Key SQL Concepts Used

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `MAX`, `COUNT`)
- CASE WHEN logic for event tagging
- Joins
- NULL handling and conversion math
- Clean conversion rate calculations (with rounding and %s)
